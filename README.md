# Node-MVC-Boilerplate

This repository is to remove the tedious work of need to write the same code again and again while creating a Full Stack Application using MVC pattern in Node and Express.
I always thought about having a Node CLI Command which would automatically generate the required files with boilerplate code that has MVC pre determined. This projet is just that.

# Project Status
As this is the alpha release, The Node CLI Command isn't available. Thus just clone this repository until the officual command releases. ü•∞‚ù§
